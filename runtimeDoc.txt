What kind of patterns do I see:

I can see that as the size of the array increases each function runtime scales at a very different rate. The append function seems to grow at a linear rate O(n) and the insert grows at an exponential rate O(n^2). The append actualy seems to start slower its not moving everything like the insert array function. The append function is better in scaling than the insert function.

Also see the attached excel sheet with runtime numbers.
